on the system (“Program(s)”). The Programs will specify the amount and terms under which Publisher will receive payment
when the applicable Program’s requirements are fulfilled. Compensation is derived from a specified event (“Event”)
identified in a Program, such as clicks, click-throughs, sales, registrations, impressions and leads. If Publisher
accepts a Program, Publisher agrees to place that Program’s advertising creative (including designated “subject” and
“from” lines, the Advertiser’s CAN-SPAM disclosures and any other disclosures provided therein) (“Specified Advertising
Materials”) on Publisher’s Media. Publisher shall display the Specified Advertising Materials exactly as they appear on
the Site and will not alter them in any way. Failure to adhere to this requirement may, in addition to all other
remedies available to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, result in termination of Publisher. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA may terminate a Program at any
time, at 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s sole discretion. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA shall take reasonable efforts, including but not limited to

administering all active Programs and tracking the payments owed.</p>
<br>

Publisher, upon our request Publisher will immediately provide 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA with appropriate records verifying that
recipient’s consent to receive email transmissions from Publisher. Such records include, but may not necessarily be

Publisher’s privacy policy.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(b). Publisher may not use an advertiser’s name (including any abbreviation thereof) in the originating email address
line or subject line of any email transmission.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(c). No Misleading Headers or Other Masking of Email Origin. An email may not include falsification of header
information, false registrations for email accounts or IP addresses used in connection with email ads, and
retransmissions of an email ad for the purpose of concealing its origin. Publisher and/or their email delivery providers
are prohibited from relaying or retransmitting emails from a computer or computer network that was accessed without
authorization.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(d). Subject lines may not be false or misleading such that it would likely mislead a reasonable recipient as to the
contents or subject matter of the message. Publisher may only use approved Specified Advertising Materials, including
subject lines available provided by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA or subject lines for which Publisher has documented approval from
13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(e). Specified Advertising Materials consisting of email messages must contain clear identification. Messages
containing advertisements or solicitations must identify themselves as such, and do so by “clear and conspicuous” means,
for example, by stating in the message body “This advertisement is brought to you by (Your Company)”. Further, the
sender must identify itself as the initiator and sender of the email including company name, email and physical address.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(f). Effective Method of Opting Out of Future Mailings. Senders of commercial emails must give recipients an
effective means of requesting not to receive future email ads from that sender. At a minimum, the publisher must give
the recipient the ability to send a reply message to unsubscribe, opt out via postal letter and provide a functioning
unsubscribe link that must remain in operation for 30 days from the date of the original email transmission.</p>
<br>

<p>2.2(g). All unsubscribe requests must be implemented within 10 business days from their receipt. You may not sell or
transfer an email address once someone has opted out of receiving future communications, whether from only the
advertiser or globally.</p>

list. Email addresses may not be obtained by the use of a program for random generation of email addresses, and/or

compliance with these Terms and Conditions, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:</p>

for compliance with applicable legal requirements, with respect to honoring unsubscribe requests and compliance with the
use of the Specified Advertising Materials. If the monitoring is done by a third party, such third party will share all
such information with 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA.</p>
<br>

<p>3.2. Each unsubscribe list furnished to a Publisher shall be separately and technologically identified so that
13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA will be able to ensure that each Publisher is not disseminating or otherwise using the unsubscribe list
other than in a manner required by applicable law. Publisher must not send further emails to names already on or newly
added to the unsubscribe list.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">4. License</h1>

<p>13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA grants Publisher a revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive limited license to use
the Site (including any Specified Advertising Materials posted thereon) and any data, reports, information or analyses
arising out of such use (the “Site Data”) solely for the purpose of marketing or promoting the Programs hereunder and
subject to these Terms and Conditions and the applicable Program Terms. If a Publisher also maintains its own network of
publishers, such Publisher may not provide the Program to its publishers, without the prior written consent of
13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA. Under such conditions, Publisher will require its publishers to agree to and comply with these Terms and
Conditions. If a Publisher fails to adhere to the foregoing requirements, in addition to any other remedies available to
13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, Publisher shall forfeit its rights to any amounts owed by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA to Publisher. Publisher
acknowledges and agrees that Publisher does not have, nor will it claim any right, title or interest in the Site
software, applications, data, methods of doing business or any elements thereof, or any content provided on the Site
(including the Specified Advertising Materials). Publisher may only access the Site via web browser, e-mail or in a
manner approved by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA. Publisher will not attempt in any way to alter, modify, eliminate, conceal, or
otherwise render inoperable or ineffective the Site tags, source codes, links, pixels, modules or other data provided by
or obtained from 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA that allows 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA to measure ad performance and provide its service. In addition,
Publisher acknowledges that all non-public information, data and reports received from 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA hereunder or as
part of the services hereunder is proprietary to and owned by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA. If instructed to do so by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA
and/or if Publisher shall be terminated by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, Publisher will immediately destroy and discontinue the use of
any 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA data, including Site Data, and any other material owned by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA or the Advertisers.
</p>

received from Publisher regarding the status of any person or entity as a 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA Client so as to aid Publisher in
its efforts to comply with the non-solicitation provisions of this Agreement. Because 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA will be irreparably
harmed by Publisher’s conduct, and because the true extent of such harm will be impossible to quantify, monetary damages
will not be an adequate remedy for any such conduct. Publisher agrees that 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA shall be entitled to injunctive
relief precluding Publisher from taking or continuing any action or conduct in violation of this provision, to be issued
by any court of competent jurisdiction upon a showing of any such violative conduct by Publisher.</p>

or Publisher can create its own website. In either event, no website shall be released online, and nonsubmission,
inclusion or any traffic can be sent to it, prior to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s review and approval of it. If Publisher already has
its own website, Publisher’s website will be subject to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s review and approval. Approval shall be written
or by electronic submission. All Program related websites will contain links (“Links”) provided by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA

which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should any of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s Client(s) provide content which includes
imbedded bots, Data Miners, links or other creative, graphic, text or html, all content shall remain at all times the
sole property of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA.</p>
<br>

<p>Publisher agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, those enforced by the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state attorneys general. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations will
result in termination of a Publisher’s account. Compliance shall be determined by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA at its sole discretion.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">6.1. Links</h1>

<p>Publisher agrees to use the Links in the exact form that we deliver them to Publisher. Publisher agrees not to modify,
alter, delete, or adapt the Links in any manner without 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s written approval. Links must be served from the

the previous sentence.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">6.2. Ownership</h1>

<p>13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA owns all rights, title, and interest to Links and user data collected and derived through the activities
countenanced pursuant to this Agreement. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA may choose to imbed certain data mining tools within Links from
time to time (“Data Miners”). Any data derived by any such Data Miner shall be the sole property of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA.

request that Publisher discontinue its use of such advertising creative, at which time Publisher shall discontinue such
use within two (2) business days of being requested by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA to do so.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">7. Deception or Fraud</h1>

<p>13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA actively monitors traffic for deceptive or fraudulent activity. If deception or fraud is detected as
determined by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s sole discretion, Publisher’s account will be made inactive pending further investigation.
Publisher accounts are flagged that, among other things:</p>
<br>

<p>Have click-through or conversion rates that are much higher than industry averages and where solid justification for
such higher click-through or conversion rates is not evident to the reasonable satisfaction of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA;</p>
<br>

<p>Have ONLY click or lead generation programs generating clicks or leads with no indication by site traffic that it can
sustain the clicks or leads reported;</p>
<br>

<p>Have shown fraudulent leads as determined by the Advertisers;</p>
<br>

<p>Have used any incentives to procure clicks or leads</p>
<br>

<p>Have provided leads obtained other than through intended consumer action. For instance, use of phone books, or similar
such compilations of personal data, to complete lead generation forms shall be considered fraudulent behavior.</p>
<br>

<p>Use fake redirects, automated software, and/or other fraudulent mechanisms to generate Events from the Programs.</p>
<br>

<p>If Publisher fraudulently adds leads or clicks or inflates leads or clicks by fraudulent traffic generation (such as
pre- population of forms or mechanisms not approved by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA or use of sites in co-registration campaigns that
have not been approved by Advertiser), as determined solely by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, Publisher will forfeit its entire
commission for all programs and its account will be terminated. If Publisher is notified that fraudulent activities may
be occurring on its Media, and Publisher fails to take prompt action to stop the fraudulent activities, then, in
addition to any other remedies available to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, Publisher shall be responsible for all costs and legal fees
arising from these fraudulent activities. In addition, in the event that Publisher has already received payment for
fraudulent activities, 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA reserves the right to seek credit or remedy from future earnings or to demand
re-imbursement from Publisher.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">8. Payment</h1>

<p>Publisher will be paid per the terms of each Program. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA shall pay any amounts due approximately 30 days
after the end of each month, less any taxes required to be withheld under applicable law, provided that 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA
may, in its discretion, withhold payments until such time as the Advertiser has paid 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA for any Program. In
addition to any other remedies that may be available to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, in the event of any breaches by Publisher of
these Terms and Conditions, Publisher shall forfeit its rights to any amounts owed by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA to Publisher.
13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA reserves the right to reduce any payments owed to Publisher as a consequence of any offsets taken by
Advertisers for invalid Events, technical errors, tracking discrepancies and the like. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA shall compile,
calculate and electronically deliver data required to determine Publisher’s billing and compensation. Any questions
regarding the data provided by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA need to be submitted in writing within 10 business days of receipt,
otherwise the information will be deemed accurate and accepted as such by Publisher. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA will not pay for any
Events that occur before a Program is initiated, or after a Program terminates. Invoices submitted to 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA and
payments made to Publisher shall be based on the Events as reported by 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA will not be
responsible to compensate Publisher for Events that are not recorded due to Publisher’s error. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA will
require a Publisher to provide a W-9, and similar such information, as a condition to payment.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">9. Special Terms for Co-Registration Campaigns</h1>

<p>With respect to Publishers who are running co-registration campaigns to generate leads (“Leads”) for Advertisers, the
following specific terms and conditions shall apply:</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">9.1. Approval of Publisher’s Site(s)</h1>

writing, (a) all sites to be used by the Publisher for each Program and (b) the transfer of leads in the form of either
a successful post for real-time transfer or approval of the test file for batch or FTP files.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="bebas">9.2. Publisher’s Privacy Policy</h1>

contemplated hereby and the Program Terms.</p>
<br>

<p>Each Program shall have its own criteria for determining the validity of a lead (the “Lead Requirements”). 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA
may detect and track all Invalid Leads, which are determined on a real-time basis. 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA shall only pay for
leads deemed valid by this system. At the sole discretion of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA, leads may also subsequently be deemed
invalid for (i) fraudulent activities including but not limited to changing approved lead generation forms, publishing
an offer on an unapproved site, utilizing automated software or manpower to complete co-registration forms,
incentivization of co-registration forms and/or a publisher’s inability to provide the user IP and time/date stamp for
each lead or (ii) non-compliance with co-registration programs including but not limited to exceeding lead caps as
communicated by a 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA Account Executive and/or going live with a co-registration offer prior to written
approval of a creative and data transfer by an 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA Account Executive.</p>

you with information about you in its database. Additionally, 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA may use other new and evolving sources of
information in the future. (a) Cookies: “Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write
cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies
assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits.
When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use
cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical
information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your

set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality
of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA’s websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that can be
used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database
and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA to
track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to
determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA

13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information
to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you
and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or
not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP
address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service
Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned
to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s
traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP,
be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area
you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may
collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA may also collect and
accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For
instance, 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used,
operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie
preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification
Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Mining: Data Mining technology may be
employed from time to time if used by a Client of 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA. (f) New Technology: The use of technology on the
Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, 13743161 Canada Ltd. DBA: DIGI8MEDIA strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>
