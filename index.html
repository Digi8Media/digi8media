<p>Including all Related Websites Owned or Registered to Digi8Media, LLC</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">Agreement to Access the Site</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA, (“DIGI8MEDIA”), a Nevada Limited Liability Company is committed to protecting your privacy. This
Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of DIGI8MEDIA and all related websites owned or
registered to DIGI8MEDIA. It does not apply to any third party websites, applications, products or services for which
DIGI8MEDIA is not responsible.

By accessing this site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy as
well as the Acceptable Use Policy and the site’s Publisher Terms and Conditions and Advertiser Terms and Conditions. IF
YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THE ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED
ON THIS SITE, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO DIGI8MEDIA OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR
PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">Changes to Privacy Policy</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy changes from time to time and changes are effective upon posting. It is your sole responsibility to
periodically review this policy for updates and you are solely responsible to be aware of any changes to this and all
posted policies on this website. DIGI8MEDIA does not provide notices of any changes in any manner other than by
posting the changes at this website.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">Information Collection, Use, and Dissemination practices</p>

<p>This policy applies to DIGI8MEDIA’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by DIGI8MEDIA on its,
(a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on
various third party websites, and (c) to DIGI8MEDIA’s other information collection, including the purchase of
customer lists from third parties, or the use of customer lists from third parties. DIGI8MEDIA is not responsible for
the information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or applications.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1. Collection of Information.</p>
<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.1. User Direct Information</p>

<p>Each time you provide information to take advantage of a promotional offer, enter to win a contest, enter to win a
sweepstake, send us an email, or otherwise transmit information via the site, DIGI8MEDIA may obtain and collect
personally identifiable information provided by you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing
address, social security number, credit card information, and telephone number. You may also provide us with information
that, when combined with personally identifiable information, provides us with a better idea of who you are, including
but not limited to your gender, birthday, marital status, and education level (collectively referred to as “personal
information”). If you choose to access our website, use our services or purchase our products, we may require you to
provide personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the site.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.2. Survey Information</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA collects information from you when you voluntarily complete a DIGI8MEDIA survey, order form, or a
registration page either online by using the internet, offline by providing this information through the mail, in person
or using a telephone. This information may be collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third
parties. This method of collection is collectively known as a “Survey.” In such Surveys, DIGI8MEDIA or a third party
may ask you to provide personal identifiable information including your name, email address, street address, zip code,
telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
information as may be requested from time to time. DIGI8MEDIA may also collect such information concerning you from
another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this website. Completing the
Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to DIGI8MEDIA or a
third party, but you may receive incentives from DIGI8MEDIA or a third party in exchange for providing such
information.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.3. Third Party List Information</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA may collect information from you when you provide information to a third party and DIGI8MEDIA
subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party. Such purchased information
may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including
cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry
of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the
third party. When acquiring this information, DIGI8MEDIA seeks assurances from the third party that it has a right to
transfer the information to DIGI8MEDIA and that the third party has a right to provide offers from advertisers to you
included on the third party list.
</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information</p>

<p>Other occasions when DIGI8MEDIA obtains information from you include (1) your claiming a prize or seeking to redeem
an incentive offered by DIGI8MEDIA or by a third party, (2) your requests for assistance through DIGI8MEDIA’s
customer service department, and (3) when you voluntarily subscribe to a DIGI8MEDIA service or newsletter.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about
you with information about you in its database. Additionally, DIGI8MEDIA may use other new and evolving sources of
information in the future. (a) Cookies: “Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write
cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies
assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits.
When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use
cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical
information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your
password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you.
Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is
set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality
of DIGI8MEDIA’s websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that can be
used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database
and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows DIGI8MEDIA to
track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to
determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, DIGI8MEDIA
also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in DIGI8MEDIA’s database. (c) IP Addresses:
DIGI8MEDIA automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information
to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you
and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or
not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP
address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service
Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned
to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s
traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP,
be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area
you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may
collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: DIGI8MEDIA may also collect and
accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For
instance, DIGI8MEDIA may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used,
operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie
preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification
Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Mining: Data Mining technology may be
employed from time to time if used by a Client of DIGI8MEDIA. (f) New Technology: The use of technology on the
Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, DIGI8MEDIA strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.6. No Information Collected from Children</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If DIGI8MEDIA
obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information
will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, DIGI8MEDIA has no such
information to use or to disclose to third parties. DIGI8MEDIA has designed this policy in order to comply with the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">1.7. Credit Card Information</p>

<p>DIGI8MEDIA may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information when an individual places
an order from DIGI8MEDIA. When the credit card information is submitted to DIGI8MEDIA, such information is
encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. DIGI8MEDIA will use the credit card information for purposes
of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the credit card information will be disclosed to third
parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>

<p class="indextextsmalltitle">2. Use of Individual Information.</p>

<p>The following section describes how DIGI8MEDIA uses personal information. The uses described in these sections may

from all lists used by DIGI8MEDIA. Because DIGI8MEDIA only sends emails when you have agreed to receive emails
